First Round
-----------
We are going to find correlations between frequency of company name mentions and their performance of the companies on the stock exchange.

Data Sets:
NYSE data (link)
Google Books Data


1.  Find yearly average stock prices
  Data set: NYSE
  Mapper Output: {symbol}_{year}\t{close_price}
  Reducer Output: {symbol}_{year}\t{ave_close_price}\t{count}

2.  Find total stock price and average for all stocks and years (for use in correlation calculation)
  Data set:  Output from #1
  Mapper:  {symbol}_{year}_stock\t{ave_close_price}\t{sum_across_all_years}\t{average_across_all_years}
  no reducer

    cat data_file_name.txt | python script_name.py > results.txt

3.  Get yearly company mentions in Google Book Data
  Data sets:  Google Book Data, Mikes map of company names
  Mapper Output:  {symbol}_{year}\t{count}
  Reducer Output:  {symbol}_{year}_book\t{count}\t{total_count_across_all_years}\t{average_across_all_years}

4.  Final Calculation
